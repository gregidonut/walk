# Walk

## Abstract 
Walk is a command line tool which crawls into
file-system directories looking for specific files.
When the files it's looking for, it can list,
archive or delete them.

You can run this tool manually, or schedule it to
run automatically by using a background job scheduler
such as *cron*.
